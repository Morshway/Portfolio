SNHU Journal Entry: Project 2
  The project was for a fictiual company called airgead banking which required me to create an app that would allow the user/client to input certain variables such as investment amounts and monthly 
  deposits in an effort to see how much annual interest they would earn. 

  I liked the interface particulary, while it was a pain to code, i found it to be the most satisfying part of the project as it was nice, easy, and looks professional. 

  I can enhance my code with practicing functions and the {} syntax. I found alot of my errors to be variable misnames or too many or missing {}. 

  The most challenging to write was the table part. I had to use external resources such as w3schools and overstack and youtube to try and figure out how to properly create a good table for my code. 

  The skills i learned from my C# scripting for my unity project. allowed me to be able to correctly and easily pick up the c++ formatting with functions {}

  The program was short, repeatable, and easy to adjust with numerous lines of comments from me from basic information to fun facts like typing rxit in my code would cause the code to spam infinite lines and 
  crash the overall program
