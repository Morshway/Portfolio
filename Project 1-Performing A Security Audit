# Morsh Toys IT Audit Report

## Introduction

This IT Audit Report presents the findings of the internal audit conducted for Morsh Toys, a small U.S. business specializing in toy development and sales. The purpose of this audit was to assess the current state of the company's security posture, identify potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

## Audit Scope and Goals

The audit scope was defined by the implementation of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The primary goals of the audit were:

1. To provide an overview of the risks the company might face in supporting its online market worldwide.

2. To identify and assess potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical IT assets.

3. To ensure compliance with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the E.U.

## Risk Assessment

The risk assessment involved a comprehensive analysis of the company's IT infrastructure, policies, and procedures. Key risk areas identified during the assessment include:

1. **Online Presence:** As Morsh Toys' online presence grows, the risk of cyberattacks and data breaches increases. The lack of a robust security framework may expose sensitive customer information.

2. **Business Continuity:** The company's single physical location poses a potential risk to business continuity in the event of a natural disaster or physical damage.

3. **Regulatory Compliance:** Morsh Toys needs to ensure compliance with payment card industry standards (PCI DSS) for accepting online payments. Additionally, compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is crucial for conducting business in the E.U.

4. **Third-Party Vendors:** The use of third-party vendors introduces the risk of supply chain attacks and data breaches, as these vendors may have access to sensitive data.

## Controls Assessment and Compliance Checklist

The audit team conducted a controls assessment to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls. A compliance checklist was also developed to ensure adherence to relevant regulations. Below are the key findings:

### 1. Information Security Controls

- **Access Control:** The company utilizes role-based access controls (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive data. However, periodic access reviews are not consistently performed.

- **Encryption:** Sensitive data in transit is encrypted using TLS/SSL. However, data-at-rest encryption for certain databases is not implemented.

- **Password Policy:** The password policy meets industry standards, requiring complex passwords and regular password changes.

### 2. Business Continuity Planning

- **Backup and Recovery:** Regular data backups are performed, but a documented disaster recovery plan is lacking.

### 3. Regulatory Compliance

- **PCI DSS Compliance:** The company has implemented some PCI DSS requirements, but further improvements are needed to meet full compliance.

- **GDPR Compliance:** The company collects and processes personal data of E.U. customers but lacks a comprehensive GDPR compliance program.

### 4. Third-Party Risk Management

- **Vendor Security Assessments:** Vendor risk assessments are conducted ad-hoc, and there is no standardized process for evaluating third-party vendors' security practices.

## Conclusion

The internal audit identified several areas for improvement in Morsh Toys' IT security posture and compliance with relevant regulations. To address the risks and vulnerabilities, the IT manager is recommended to:

- Strengthen access controls by conducting regular access reviews.
- Implement data-at-rest encryption for all sensitive databases.
- Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity.
- Enhance PCI DSS and GDPR compliance efforts.
- Establish a formal vendor risk management program with standardized security assessments.

By addressing these findings and implementing the necessary improvements, Morsh Toys can better secure its infrastructure and demonstrate its commitment to cybersecurity and compliance. These audit findings can serve as evidence to support the IT manager's request for the expansion of the IT department.

This report is intended to assist Morsh Toys in enhancing its security posture and achieving its business objectives securely and compliantly. The IT department should regularly review and update security measures to adapt to evolving threats and regulations.
